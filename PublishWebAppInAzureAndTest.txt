# In this script, you'll need to replace the placeholders with the actual values for your Azure resource group name, 
# web app name, slot name (if applicable), and the URLs for your web app and API.
 
# You'll also need to replace _your-publish-artifact-name.zip with the name of the artifact 
# that contains the application files to be published to Azure.

# Once you've updated the script with the appropriate values, you can save it as a 
# .ps1 file and run it in a PowerShell environment to push the software changes 
# through your Azure Pipeline and test the publishing of the application and API connectivity to Azure.
